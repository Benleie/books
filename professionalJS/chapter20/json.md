JSON parsed into a usable object in JavaScript  || XML parsed into a DOM document

JSON could be passed directly to eval() and didnâ€™t require the creation of a DOM.

## Syntax
Simple Values: JSON strings must use double quotes to be valid (single quotes causes a syntax error).

Objects: object property names in JSON must always be double-quoted.

Arrays: Objects and arrays are typically top-level parts of a JSON data structure (even though this is not required)
