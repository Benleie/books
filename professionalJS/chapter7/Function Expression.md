# Closure
activation object,variable object
> When a function is called, an execution context is created, and its scope chain is created. The activation object for the function is initialized with values for  arguments and any named arguments. The outer functionâ€™s activation object is the second object in the scope chain. This process continues for all containing functions until the scope chain terminates with the global execution context.
